The data were previous collected and posted on UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository located at the below web address:

Per the authors of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, the data were collected as follows:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.




***************************FINAL TIDY DATA SET***************************

Activity_Title - Six (6) activities performed by each subject.  
                 Activities are as follows: (WALKING
, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
, SITTING, STANDING
,                  LAYING)

Subject_ID - Thirty (30) participants in the experiments.  
	     Subject_IDs range from 1 to 30

Variable - Contains the means and standard deviations of the 3 axial components of two sensor signals, one signal generated by an accelerometer and one 		   signal generated by a gyroscrope.  The sensor acceleration signal was further divided into a gravitational and a body motion component.  Both the             accelerometer and the gyroscope variables were passed through filters leading to an extension of the variables in the set that begins with the                letter "f".  

           Variables are as follows: 
           tBodyAc.mean...X       tBodyAcc.mean...Y      tBodyAcc.mean...Z      tBodyAcc.std...X      tBodyAcc.std...Y       tBodyAcc.std...Z

           tBodyGyro.mean...X     tBodyGyro.mean...Y     tBodyGyro.mean...Z     tBodyGyro.std...X     tBodyGyro.std...Y      tBodyGyro.std...Z

           fBodyAcc.mean...X      fBodyAcc.mean...Y      fBodyAcc.mean...Z      fBodyAcc.std...X      fBodyAcc.std...Y       fBodyAcc.std...Z

           Units: time captured at a rate of 50 Hz - variables preceded by t.  frequency - variabels preceded by f.
